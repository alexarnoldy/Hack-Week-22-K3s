## Progress

.From 01/30 - 02/03 we accomplished the following

* Installed two servers with openSUSE minimal
** Updated to kernel-default and added utilities such as podman, etcdctl, nmap
* Configured Keepalived under podman, using a macvlan overlay on the backend network
* Installed and configured DRBD, also on the macvlan network
* Ran etcd on both nodes, in podman, with unique IP addresses on the macvlan network
* Ran a single transient etcd instance, in podman, with a simliar network configuration and its data directory on the DRBD device 
** Unique ports are required on the transient instance
* Switched the transient instance from one node to the other:
** Stopped the container
** Unmounted the filesystem
** Mounted the filesystem on the other node
** Ran the container on the other node
* The etcd cluster remains responsive throughout the exercise

.On 02/07/23 installed K3s with KINE

* Will update the instructions in gist but it works exactly as advertised.
* Right now the only two missing pieces are to get DRBD to behave itself and create the scripts to manage fencing and running the transient instance on the appropriate node

.Issues uncovered / tasks left outstanding

* I thought Keepalived + a load balancer would be needed, but then discovered that the KINE interface for etcd points to all etcd instances, so it is not
** I am removing the Keepalived portion of the directions.
* DRBD doesn't maintain the shared device between reboots. It must be removed and recreated after rebooting the nodes
* Basic scripts need to be created to run the logic of monitoring node health and reacting appropriately
** The NATS/Jetstream team came up with an interesting idea of gathering external and internal data points and then running them 
   through a logic engine to determine how impaired the cluster is and limiting service appropriately
** Not sure how this would work with etcd, since it's just the data store, not the decision maker
* Still needs TLS integrated into etcd

.Around 04/2023 tested eliminating DRBD

* Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the notes, but I did get it to work by scp'ing over a copy of the `etcd` directory to the sibling node after a node has taken over.
* Uses the same logic as described in the `etcd-for-two-node-HA-K3s-cluster.pdf` document.
