## Progress

.From 01/30 - 02/03 we accomplished the following

* Installed two servers with openSUSE minimal
** Updated to kernel-default and added utilities such as podman, etcdctl, nmap
* Configured Keepalived under podman, using a macvlan overlay on the backend network
* Installed and configured DRBD, also on the macvlan network
* Ran etcd on both nodes, in podman, with unique IP addresses on the macvlan network
* Ran a single transient etcd instance, in podman, with a simliar network configuration and its data directory on the DRBD device 
** Unique ports are required on the transient instance
* Switched the transient instance from one node to the other:
** Stopped the container
** Unmounted the filesystem
** Mounted the filesystem on the other node
** Ran the container on the other node
* The etcd cluster remains responsive throughout the exercise

.Issues uncovered / tasks left outstanding

* A full load balancer is needed since Keepalived is providing an extra IP address on the node, not on the containers
* DRBD doesn't maintain the shared device between reboots. It must be removed and recreated after rebooting the nodes
* Basic scripts need to be created to run the logic of monitoring node health and reacting appropriately
** The NATS/Jetstream team came up with an interesting idea of gathering external and internal data points and then running them 
   through a logic engine to determine how impaired the cluster is and limiting service appropriately
** Not sure how this would work with etcd, since it's just the data store, not the decision maker
